The Cube.Xui package has bindings, converters, commands, behaviors, and other components
to provide support the MVVM pattern in WPF applications. The package is available for .NET Framework 3.5, 4.5, .NET Core 3.1, or later. Note that basic functionality for the MVVM pattern is implemented in the [Cube.Core](https://github.com/cube-soft/cube.core), and the WinForms part is in the [Cube.Forms](https://github.com/cube-soft/cube.forms).
